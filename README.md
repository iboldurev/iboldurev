### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi every one Im Ivan a full-stack developer from Ukraine.
I've started my journey as a developer 13 years ago when I finished colledge back in 2007 and started to learn early php and first frameworks.
Ever since I work commercially, so my 13 years of experience are commercial and I've completed more that 70 projects both simple and more complex.
Im happy to take on new challenges and ideas, so looking forward to your project.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
